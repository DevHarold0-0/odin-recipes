        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe will knock your socks off. A simple yet mouth watering apple pie will make you wish you were a child again; playing tag on a hot sunny day as the sun sets. The aroma calls for you like ships to sirens. In other words it's to die for.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>5 Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored, quartered, and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3 (9 inch) refrigerated prerolled pie crusts</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into small chunks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place 1/2 cup butter into a 9-inch cast iron skillet; place the skillet in the preheated oven until butter is melted. Remove the skillet and sprinkle with brown sugar; return to the oven to heat while you prepare the apples.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from the oven; arrange 1 refrigerated pie crust on top of brown sugar. Top pie crust with 1/2 of the sliced apples. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon on top. Place second pie crust over apples; top second crust with remaining apples and sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Top with third crust; sprinkle with 1/4 cup sugar and dot with 1 tablespoon of butter. Cut 4 slits into the top crust for steam to escape.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Serve warm. </li>
        </ol>
